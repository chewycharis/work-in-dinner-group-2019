Muller-Brown potential and gradient were set according to the referenced paper; Integrator used was BAOAB with step size dt=0.001 and friction coefficient gamma=0.05/0.001. 
100,000 trajectories were started by randomly drawing two points in the uniform distribution of Ux(-2.5,1.5) and Uy(-1.5,2.5). For the first 5 steps, energy was checked such that if energy is higher than 100, the points would be  tossed away and the trajectory would be restarted. All trajectories were run for 500 steps in total. The trajectory coordinates were saved for every 25 steps, resulting in 20 coordinates per trajectory. Then, the first coordinates were tossed away, and every 3rd coordinates were saved, resulting in a total of 7 points per trajectory.
