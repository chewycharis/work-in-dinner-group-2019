Obvious things to look at off the top of my head …
SASA of W6
DSSP

claims that 
* Y3/P19 is an important interaction; 
* W6 / P18 not so much;
* D9/R16 salt bridge 
→ perhaps we can do a residue residue COM distance?

potentially useful for setting up Gromacs

looked at these in addition to things before 
W6 side chain dihedral angles  ← seems useful see figure s5
W6/P12  ← apparently happens first 
Y3/P19 ‘s distance can vary widely

used Trp-cage as benchmark model for whatever method…. 
CV includes...global conformational change, a global degree of backbone dihedral rotations, contact formations for hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic contacts, as well as the presence of both α and β secondary structure elements.

tensors of gyration and inertia

CV1: number of Cc contacts; 
CV2: number of Ca contacts; 
CV3: number of backbone h-bonds. 
CV4: fraction of y dihedrals belonging to the a region in the Ramachandran plot
CV5: correlation between successive y dihedrals
